He later had an on-and-off relationship with Danielle Schreiber for about a decade, during which they conceived a son via in vitro fertilization. However, after their split in 2012, Patric was initially denied custody of his son due to his unmarried status to Schreiber being considered only a sperm donor. He sued for parental rights but lost the case.</p><p>Patric’s struggle for parental rights led him to lobby the California legislature to recognize parental rights for sperm donors. His efforts paid off in 2014, when a court legally recognized him as the father of his son.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC2wKymp2WglsGztcJmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./look-of-the-day-2022-11-07-6826455.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jessica Simpson Wore Black Platform Boots With Jeans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blisstree.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>blisstree</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
