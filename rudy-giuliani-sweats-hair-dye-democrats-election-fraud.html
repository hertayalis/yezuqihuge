lawsuits, claiming it was "not a singular voter fraud in one state."</p><p>On the president's official YouTube page, the livestream of the conference featured an unfortunate<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> hot mic incident</a>, when someone could be heard saying "You see f***ing see Rudy's hair dye dripping down his face?"</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Motherjones</a> reporter noted that when the Trump team noticed the error, they muted the audio leading to Live Chat conspiracy theories about "big tech censorship."</p><p>"[It's] a pattern that repeat itself in a number of states," <a href=#>Giuliani</a> claimed before sweat began to pour down his face at about 12.45pm ET, just over 30 minutes into the briefing.</p><p>"[There was] a plan from a centralized place to execute these various act of voter fraud," he said, claiming it "specifically focussed on big cities controlled by Democrats."</p><img

repeatedly told her "you are lying" and "don't lie to people" .</p><p>He also laughed loudly when another reporter asked a question and said she was from CNN in the explosive showdown.</p><p>Giuliani, who was flanked by attorneys Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell, claimed cities like Detroit and Philadelphia were "big cities that have a long history of corruption."</p><p>The attorney declared that voter fraud in the <a href=#>Pennsylvania</a> "could fill a library" and said he would only have been surprised if Philly "hadn't cheated" and that "you could say the same thing in Detroit."</p><img

<a href=#>Nevada</a>, <a href=#>Georgia</a>, <a href=#>Michigan</a>, <a href=#>Arizona</a>, and <a href=#>Wisconsin</a> after multiple Trump suits were thrown out.</p><p>He said that the press had repeatedly dismissed affidavits from people claiming that GOP inspectors were "penned" and treated badly.</p><p>He made multiple allegations about the mail-in ballots sent in to polling stations as a result of <a href=#>coronavirus</a>, claiming this included the same person voting 30 times in Pennsylvania, an allegation that has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Giuliani brought up "My Cousin Vinny" (1992) a movie about a New York Lawyer Vincent Gambini, likening one scene involving a witness with poor eyesight to GOP observers trying to look at the ballot count.</p><p>"'How many fingers do I got up?' 'Three,'" he said, imitating the actor Joe Pesci in a faux Brooklyn accent and holding up two fingers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000621091236.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1.01.32-PM.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-12.48.42-PM.png><p>Giuliani cited the Cheryl Costantino <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">case</a>, in which a judge noted that the witnesses only came forward about ballot discrepancies after Biden won and said a rental truck transporting ballots doesn't equal an "evil activity."</p><p>During the fraught conference, Trump tweeted that it was an "an open and shut case of voter fraud. Massive numbers!"</p><p>Trump's team then claimed that George Soros and the Clinton Foundation were involved in this "centralized" conspiracy to rig the election.</p><p>Giuliani also told reporters Biden "doesn't answer questions much less give you sworn affidavits."</p><p>"When went to bed, [Trump] was ahead in all those states," Giuliani raged. "It kind of begs credulity that it all happened in every single state –&nbsp;my goodness, this is how you win cases in a courtroom."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-2.30.14-PM.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/TRUMP-ELLIS-LEGAL-ADVISOR-IDIOT-COMP-JF.jpg><p>"Our goal is to go around the iron curtain of censorship ... And give facts to the American people that if you were a fair, and honest network, you would be reporting for the past two weeks," he told a CNN journalist.</p><p>"Let's go from the big pictures to the small pciture," he said later. "This has been a massive attack. ... the people who did this, have committed one of the biggest crimes I've seen or observed.</p><p>"They have trashed the right to vote they've destroyed the right to vote," Giuliani ranted. "This is a plan. You would have to be a fool [not to see it].</p><p>"When I see crooked city, go look at how many of their officials have gone to jail over the past 20 or 30 years.</p><p>"They picked the places," he added, claiming that judges were pointed politically after Trump's lawsuits were denied in three states.</p><p>Giuliani was evasive about where they would file more lawsuits and claimed the GOP cases that were dismissed, denied, or rejected, most recently in <a href=#>Michigan</a> today.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>He claimed this was because of "friendly judges that issue ridiculous irrational opinions," adding that they were "about to" file in <a href=#>Georgia</a> and will "probably" file in <a href=#>Arizona</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Speaking about Wayne County, MI, Giuliani –&nbsp;who hasn't served as a lawyer in an NYC court case since 1992, reports say –&nbsp;falsely said "they decertified" their results when they did in fact vote to certify the election there.</p><p>"This is what you can expect to see when we get to court to actually have a full trial on the merits to actually show this evidence in court and prove our case," Ellis said, hours after their Michigan case was withdrawn.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Trump campaign suffers embarrassing hot mic incident during Giuliani presser</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdhbX94gJRtZqutlK56qLXUpaCappliwLixwK2qZqCRnr9usNieZJ2dnaSws63TrGSepJWYwaq7zWadq5mlmXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./abe-vigoda-net-worth-123056.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Abe Vigoda Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./asus-u30jc-refining-thin-and-light-performance.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Refining Thin and Light Performance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
