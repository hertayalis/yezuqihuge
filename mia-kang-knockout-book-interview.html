She simultaneously kept up with her studies, eventually earning a master's degree in finance and financial law. At one point she left the modeling biz to become a commodities trader, but then returned to the runway in her mid-20s. Shortly after that, in 2017, she landed a spot in <i>Sports Illustrated</i>'s famed swimsuit issue as a contender for Rookie of the Year. But her success came at a price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the start of her career, Kang has battled eating disorders and anxiety. And by the time she hit her late 20s, Kang was burned out. So she took a break to travel and see family living in Thailand. It's there that she discovered a passion for the martial art of Muay Thai, which in turn gave her the strength to tackle body-image issues head-on. Now, with her debut book, <i><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Knockout</a>,</i> out today, the 31-year-old is rewriting the rules for body standards within her industry and beyond. "I never thought I'd be able to have a healthy relationship with food or my body," she says. "Now I want to tell everybody that recovery and happiness are possible. That's why I'm putting my story out there."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Fighting Spirit: </b>For Kang, Muay Thai — a combat sport involving punches, kicks, and elbow and knee strikes — was always about more than winning. "I connected to the philosophical part of martial arts more so than the physical," she says. " 'Cause, yeah, it's a great workout. But there was something else in it for me." The practice proved to be the jolt she needed to go back into modeling with an uncompromising attitude. "The most badass thing I've ever done wasn't beating someone up [in a professional fight]," she says. "It was telling everybody who told me what I was supposed to look like that I'm not going to look like that anymore."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$26; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Model Mission: </b>Kang was visiting Thailand in mid-February when the country's borders shut down in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and she's been there ever since. She has stayed sane through this tough time by focusing on the final edits of her book and reflecting on what this period has taught her. "Especially now, being able to say you are a conscious, responsible human being is more important than losing 5 pounds or having abs," she says. "Women are tired of being told what they should look like. It's time to normalize normalness. And I want to create that safe and honest space for people to feel good about themselves."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>Kang's book, </i><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Knockout</a>,<i> is available on October 20.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8yimGajkaO0brfNqJqkp6WpeqO7zqRkoqakmr%2B3tcSw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pair-eyewear-shark-tank-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pair Eyewear Shark Tank Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gaga-confirms-engagement-christian-carino.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gaga Confirms Engagment to Her Agent Christian Carino</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
