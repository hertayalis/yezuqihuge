From his legendary music career to his decently successful acting career, which includes appearances in popular movies like&nbsp;Trolls World Tour.&nbsp;However, today Justin proved that you can‚Äôt be good at everything, and even the super-talented have their off days.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Like many musicians and actors, Timberlake has made an account on the popular video-sharing platform&nbsp;TikTok.&nbsp;And, as Beyonc√© recently showed, an established celebrity‚Äôs first video on the platform tends to quickly go viral, with fans cheering them on and celebrating their arrival on the social media platform. However, Justin‚Äôs first foray onto the site didn‚Äôt go as well as he would have liked.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@beyonce href=#>@beyonce</a><p>Seeing y‚Äôall release the wiggle made me so happy!

However, Justin‚Äôs prediction turned out to be wrong.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@justintimberlake href=#>@justintimberlake</a><p>ü´†</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Justin Timberlake" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Justin Timberlake</a></figure><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>While the video quickly broke four million views, many of the 15,000 comments were very negative, with many using this forum to critique Timberlake for his past actions.&nbsp;The most popular comment calls back to one of the most infamous moments of Timberlake‚Äôs career, the infamous 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show incident where Janet Jackson‚Äôs breast was accidentally exposed.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=24 data-current-count=24 data-injectable=false>The comment reads:&nbsp;</p><p>Janet Jackson deserved more from you. I‚Äôm all set</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>And it has acquired more than five thousand likes, showing that many people have not forgiven Justin for this incident or his reaction to it in the years since.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>The second most liked comment, also with more than five thousand likes, refers to Justin Timberlake‚Äôs infamous treatment of former paramour Britney Spears, saying:&nbsp;</p><p>You owe Ms. Spears an APOLOGY</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>Timberlake apologized to Jackson and Spears on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> last year, but for many, it was too little too late and self-serving as public opinion of him took a dip.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Another user pointed out that Justin isn‚Äôt the first NSYNC member to join TikTok. And this video proves that he isn‚Äôt even the most loved member of NSYNC on the platform. One user commented:&nbsp;</p><p>Uh oh‚Ä¶ do we tell him that @lancebass is already here and doing it better?</p><p data-characters=45 data-current-count=45 data-injectable=false>Justin‚Äôs account did respond by saying:</p><p>Oh, you don‚Äôt need to tell me! @Lance Bass is the goat.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>And a quick glance at Bass‚Äô comments section shows that the TikTok userbase is much kinder to him and his antics.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true><a title=@lancebass href=#>@lancebass</a><p>Sunday Funday >>>> Sunday Scaries</p><a title="‚ô¨ the joke is on you. icarly - Kate" href=#>‚ô¨ the joke is on you. icarly ‚Äì Kate</a></figure><p data-characters=6 data-current-count=6 data-injectable=false>&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=107 data-injectable=false>TikTok‚Äôs official account jumped into the comments to second Justin‚Äôs point, saying that:</p><p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs gonna go really well too.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>This shows that while the platform‚Äôs popularity is expanding exponentially. Its social media team isn‚Äôt always correct. Especially as the dunking on Justin has been crossposted to Twitter.
