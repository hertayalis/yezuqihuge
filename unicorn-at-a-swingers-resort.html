I know many monogamists that insist upon being the center of sexual attention —&nbsp;always —&nbsp;but as a unicorn, that focus often inadvertently sways in my favor with little to no effort. I’ve embraced being a third, a relationship novelty. Yet you’re never an afterthought – your extra set of hands, boobs, mouth and ass are highly sought after by couples. In my experience, swingers are eager to make their unicorns happy and take a team approach to pleasure. That attention only begets more sexual energy from ever-grateful me. Everybody wins.</p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tips-for-anal-sex.jpg alt="anal sex tips" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">25 Tips to Enjoy Anal Sex From Someone Who Loves It</span></a></p><p><strong>More: </strong>What to do when one partner wants an open marriage</p><p>I recently had the full-tilt unicorn experience at Hedonism, the granddaddy of nudist resorts, in Negril, Jamaica. I tend to live in a “make your own fun” mindset, but Hedonism is adult fun on steroids. It’s a tropical paradise where anything goes —&nbsp;however you choose to define it. For some, it may be as mild as watching couples on the clothing optional side of the resort. After dark, things get wilder. (I’ll leave it at that and let your imagination run cray cray.)</p><p>As a single female, albeit one in an ethically non-monogamous relationship, I garnered an uptick of attention from men, women and couples that I wouldn’t normally receive on a solo girl’s getaway. Not everyone wanted to have sex with me, but they sure were curious as to why a seemingly nice woman was at a nudist resort by herself. The answer is pretty simple: I like sex, and although I have a partner who adores and satisfies me, my interests are vast and I seek variety in experiences. Cue the almighty mythical unicorn status.</p><p>Sex aside, I like the (generally) sex-positive attention that being a unicorn attracts. At Hedonism, it meant I had an automatic network of friends. Friends who were sexual, but respectful, flirty and fun. People made their intentions clear, but never pressured me to play. I felt safe at every turn, even when there was alcohol and sexed-up endorphins involved. (The environment lends itself to all manners of sexy —&nbsp;at all times.) Consent was a constant, and in my experience, swingers are mindful of boundaries (although maybe not to the same degree as the kink community, but I’ll save those observations for another day). Sitting from my perspective, it was an all-you-can-eat (no pun intended) buffet of straight-up sexual pleasure. What’s not to love?</p><p><strong>More: </strong><a href=#>My husband sleeps with other women and I’m OK with it</a></p><p>As a unicorn, I’ve had no-strings-attached threesomes and given wives their first ever orgasm from a woman. If you’re a noncommittal woman like me who gets off on giving and receiving, there’s nothing quite as satisfying as giving pinch-hit pleasure. When a woman says, “Hey honey, did you see how she did XYZ,” you know your part in their bedroom is going to fan some super-hot after-the-fact sex. Whether I get off or not, playing that unique role is pretty hot.</p><p>For me, being a unicorn is all about flexing sexual freedom, and hopefully, tag-teaming some creative curiosity with a GGG (good giving game) couple along the way. Not only do such scenarios enhance my sex life, but I’d like to believe they can open up new sexual landscapes and multiply the pleasure for others. Swinging isn’t a make-or-break, all-the-time thing for me —&nbsp;just one piece of my complex puzzle of sexual interests. But if I’m going to partake, I sure do like playing from a sparkly, magical position. Rainbows optional.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqGcmqSknXqiusNmrp6knKOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsrR7kGppbGlmany2usicpqumXZbBbq2MrK6ippeav7R50Z6qqKqkZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiffany-and-ronald-now-90-day-fiance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are '90 Day Fianc' Stars Tiffany and Ronald Living Together After Welcoming a Baby Girl?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uses-special-toothpaste-on-crossword-clue.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Uses special toothpaste on crossword clue answer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
