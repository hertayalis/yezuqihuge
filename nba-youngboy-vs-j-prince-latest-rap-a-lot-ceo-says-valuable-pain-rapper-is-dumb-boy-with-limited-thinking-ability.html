Prince has responded after rapper Youngboy Never Broke Again (Kentrell DeSean Gaulden) told him to “mind his business.”</p><p>J. Prince (James L. Prince) described Youngboy as a “dumb boy with limited thinking ability,” who took his “kindness for weakness.”</p><p>The Rap-A-Lot CEO fired the verbal shots at Youngboy in a video he uploaded to his Instagram yesterday, titled “A MESSAGE TO DUMB BOY.”</p><p>J. Prince <a href=#>says in the video</a>:</p><p>“You’re a dumb boy with limited thinking ability and disrespectful. Acting like you and your brother wasn’t down with me and letting it be known that you was mob ties…</p><p>What you should be mad about is the lie you’re living and the weak-ass security being sleep in front of your house.”</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by J Prince (@jprincerespect)</a> on Jun 23, 2020 at 12:52pm PDT</p><h2>Youngboy told J. Prince to “mind his business”</h2><p>The tongue-lashing statement on Instagram was in response to <a href=#>rapper Youngboy</a>&nbsp;saying that J. Prince should “mind his f**k**g business” after burglars <a href=#>broke into Youngboy’s home</a> last week and stole some of the rapper’s stuff.</p><p>The music executive got in touch with the culprits and then uploaded a video to let Youngboy and everyone know that he had found Youngboy’s missing stuff, including the keys to his Rolls Royce and McLaren.</p><p>“Lil homie Youngboy place got broke into. People went in his place, disrespected different things, and… I got a call about it.</p><p>And the lil homies that went into this place wanna make that right… I got your keys to your Rolls Royce. I got your keys to your McLaren.”</p><p><a href=#>NBA Youngboy</a> did not appreciate J. Prince making a public statement about his personal affairs through a video uploaded online.</p><p>He <a href=#>uploaded a video</a> in which he told J. Prince that he did not appreciate the publicity and that <a href=#>he should mind his business</a>:</p><p>“It’s plenty ways to get in touch with me. Man, don’t get on no internet and do no publicly… None of that p***y **s s**t… Mind your f**king business, man.”</p><h2>J. Prince answered that he was minding his business</h2><p>J. Prince concluded his response to <a href=#>Youngboy Never Broke Again</a> by initially striking a guardedly conciliatory tone: he said he did not consider Youngboy a friend or an enemy despite what had happened and that he would like to keep it that way.</p><p>However, he ended his statement by saying that he was minding his business when he contacted the criminals and recovered Youngboy’s stuff.</p><p>“By the way, I’m minding my business. You just too dumb to know Texas is my business and I will give you whatever you ask for. Good or bad.”</p><p>J. Prince is a well-known music promoter and CEO of Rap-A-Lot, a hip-hop record label based in Houston, Texas. He also previously managed top professional boxers, including Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6cnKWdkqe2tcWOp5maZamkwq%2BzwaiwZq6jYrduvNGipZydXaGutbHSrWSrmaBirm64zq1knJ2fYsCixdJmrZqkpZavrbGMqZiipl2nrrG8xKtkoqtdmcKuroybprJlp57BqXnLoqSirJWZerW0yKeioqaXYq6jtcuiq7Jn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-brown-net-worth-176426.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Brown Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-mckidd.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin McKidd</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
