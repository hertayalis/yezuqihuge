The couple first connected at a book club event in 2009 and tied the knot the following year. Robach’s two daughters, Ava (2002) and Analise (2006) are the kids of her marriage to Tim McIntosh. Robach became a stepmother to the Melrose Place alum’s three sons, Nate, Aidan, and Wyatt, after the couple tied the knot. Shue has joint custody of the children with his ex-wife Jennifer Hageney.</p><p>In an exclusive interview in 2017, Shue gushed about the relationship between her and her husband’s offspring, saying, “At least five nights a week we sit down to dinner together.” More than that, we give each child individual attention. This has a profound effect on the partnership. It doesn’t have to cost a lot, but it will be well worth it.</p><p>The native Michiganders praised their parenting style. We’d rather put our money toward activities than stuff. “It’s easy to lose track of those details,” she admitted. One of the most meaningful things I’ve ever done with my money and time was to take my daughters to a Broadway show for Christmas instead of buying them clothes. There is no way to erase or restore memory.</p><p>The couple used their story as the basis for a children’s book that came out in October of 2021. Robach and Shue told Publisher’s Weekly in an interview that month that they had written stories about the animals in their backyard forming a family and going on adventures together when they were going through the process of blending their families. We’ve only recently had the time and perspective to try to help others who are in the midst of blending and raising families, now that four of our five children are in college or beyond.</p><h2><strong>Did Amy Robach and TJ Holmes have an affair?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Did-Amy-Robach-and-TJ-Holmes-have-an-affair.jpg><p><strong>Amy Robach and TJ Holmes had an affair for several months before they both left their spouses in August of 2022.</strong> For the record, Robach has been married to actor Andrew Shue since 2010 and Holmes to lawyer Marilee Fiebig since 2010.
