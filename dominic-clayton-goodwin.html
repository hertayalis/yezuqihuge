Nick was a bright light with a million-dollar smile that lit up the spaces he occupied, and when he greeted you with a hug, the positive energy made you feel secure and loved. Nick possessed an undeniable sense of fashion and enjoyed dressing in one of his many suits, accompanied by his signature bowtie.
