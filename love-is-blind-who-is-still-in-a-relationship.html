Lauren and Cameron appeared to be a match made in heaven after meeting one another in the pods and happily said 'yes' to one another during their televised marriage. Three years later, they are still going strong! Sharing an album of photos of the pair in 2022, Lauren wrote: "I appreciate how every time a new #LIB drops y’all show me and @cameronreidhamilton so much love 3 years later. Y’all really hold us down."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3741b4234fe2-loveisblindseason1episode1200080208.jpg><h3>Amber Pike and Matt Barnett</h3><p id=eqJynYhawcya data-wc=80>Amber and Matt are also still very happily married! Matt most recently celebrated his "gorgeous and amazing" wife in a sweet Valentine’s Day post about a trip to Sedona in Arizona. He wrote: "As we explored the stunning red rocks, breathtaking views, and rugged terrain, I couldn't help but be in awe of her natural beauty and adventurous spirit. She is truly a force of nature, and being by her side makes every moment feel like a once-in-a-lifetime experience." Aw!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2b007f98eebb-loveisblindseason1episode1300103501.jpg><h2>Who is still together from Love is Blind season 2?</h2><p id=epjkhZFMkHnF data-wc=73>While some couples did last the time of time, remaining hitched long after the cameras had been packed up, they have sadly all announced plans to divorce. Iyanna McNeely and Jarrette Jones seemed like the perfect couple but confirmed that they were going their separate ways back in August 2022 in a post which read: "After much thought, we're saddened to share that we have separated and will begin the process of divorcing.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/934770706ab3-libs2unit14664r.jpg><p id=e3PPmxf7S5rg data-wc=39>"While we have love for each other, our lives are going in different directions, and that's okay." The only other couple who remained together after the show, Danielle Ruhl and Nick Thompson, also announced that they planned to divorce.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2>Who is still together from Love is Blind season 3?&nbsp;</h2><h3>Alexa Alfia and Brennon Lemieux&nbsp;</h3><p id=eNjoFDUwQHj6 data-wc=89>This sweet pair are still together, with Brennan telling Us Weekly back in November 2022: "Things are great. Things are wonderful. We’ve been able to finally get the families together for a bunch of different events“Life is wonderful. Life is great." Alexa added: "We’re just really living our best life. I think it really was a surprise how easy marriage life is when you like, really have your one. It’s amazing." Alexa also recently shared a snap of her handsome hubby, writing: "You the best I ever had."

Speaking about their relationship in an open letter to Matt, Colleen wrote: "A year and a half later and I continue to love you more and more each day. You are my love, my person, my best friend, my chef, my dance partner, my world traveller, my movie buddy, my golfer, my lobster, my silly goose…my everything. Quoting myself, 'Cheers to getting Litty as a Titty for the rest of our lives!'" The pair confirmed in June 2023 that they are now living together, sweet!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ac608687b40-3170015326039525214831655810132119361609329n.jpg><h2>Who is still together from Love is Blind season 4?</h2><h3>Tiffany Pennywell and Brett Brown</h3><p id=eJOh63XyeH data-wc=69>After instantly clicking on the show, we're so happy that Tiffany and Brett have continued to make their romance (and marriage) work! Speaking at the Netflix Tudum event, Tiffany said: "I love that my love for him has just grown deeper and deeper. I wake up every morning and I’m just so thankful. Like, oh my gosh, I’m still pinching myself that I found him on a TV show."</p><h3>Kwame Appiah and Chelsea Griffin Appiah</h3>Despite "growing pains" from their marriage after deciding to stay together, Kwame and Chelsea are still very much wed. Chelsea explained: "This is a marriage. We are real people. We have jobs, we have stressors and the speed of this process is intense." We love that the two of them are making it work!<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/05683b38e36b-screenshot-2023-09-22-at-161451.png><h3>Zack Goytowski and Bliss Poureetezadi</h3><p id=eZDjnHfERi data-wc=104>Despite their very rocky start in the world of romance, Zack and Bliss are still together, and are living with one another - even though it meant Bliss rehoming her pet dog and cat due to Zack's allergies. Zack said: "The fact she was willing to make that sacrifice for me just tells you everything you need to know about her heart. She was willing to give that up so we could be together." However, Zack surprised Bliss by taking allergy shots before bringing her pet dog home again, with her explaining: "I was just sobbing. It was really just so sweet and touching."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/50c294596cce-screenshot-2023-09-22-at-161426.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tb3JpZWZ8rbvVnmSiq12Xuaq6w2auoaddnsBuv9Oio6VlmaN6onnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./335630-saweetie-laughs-off-jokes-about-her-running-skills-in-fast-motion-video-news.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Saweetie Laughs Off Jokes About Her Running Skills In &amp;quot;Fast (Motion)&amp;quot; Video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-thee-stallion-justin-timberlake-vmas-collaboration-7971982.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is a Megan Thee Stallion and Justin Timberlake Collaboration in Our Future?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
