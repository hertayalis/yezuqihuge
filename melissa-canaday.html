Her TV sitcom, Modern Family, pays her about <strong>$100,000</strong> per episode. So Melissa is undoubtedly living a nice life in the United States with her family and marriage.</p><h2><span id=Melissa_Canaday-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Melissa Canaday- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Melissa Canaday was born to American parents in the United States.

The media is unable to provide any information about Melissa Canaday’s birthday or zodiac sign due to a lack of knowledge about her actual birth date. Her daughter, Sydney, on the other hand, is now 28 years old.

She married her long-term boyfriend turned husband, Edward James Hyland.

Even after several treatments and check-ups, Canaday was forced to seek therapy after discovering a firm lump in her breast. Melissa’s family and children have always been supportive in any scenario.</p><p>Despite being diagnosed with breast cancer, Canaday preferred to live a tranquil life. She once admitted in an interview:</p><p>“I’ve told people this and they think I’m crazy, but breast cancer was probably one of the nicest things that could have happened to me.” And I realize that sounds strange and bizarre. But it brought me back to myself, and I now live every day for myself.”</p><p>Melissa was completely cured of her condition after taking Herceptin for a year. She stated after becoming cancer-free:</p><p>“Now I grieve for my friends who are getting it, and I cry for my friends who have had it and are experiencing a recurrence.”</p><p>Melissa currently runs various projects and raises donations for cancer patients. She has now received over $75,000 in donations from individuals. We applaud her commitment to helping others.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Abilio James Acosta</a>, <a href=#>Ladd Drummond</a>, and <a href=#>Ryans Williams</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity star</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Celeste Star</a></h3>Celeste Star estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
