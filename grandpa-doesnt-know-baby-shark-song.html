His own family can't stop laughing in the video, every single time he sings the "do-do-do-do" part.</p><p>Cristalena (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@cristalenap</a>) uploaded the clip online when it amassed a whopping 11.7 million views on the popular social media application. The video begins with the grandfather in question sitting down with his grandchild and reading a baby shark book to the kid.</p><p>"Daddy shark, do-do-do-do-do," he says in a rapid cadence that sounds nothing like the now-ubiquitous viral children's song that has become a fixture of the internet.</p><p>He repeats the refrain again, "Daddy shark, do-do-do-do-do," before looking to his grandchild and remarking that all of the sharks in the story "say the same thing."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cristalenap href=#>@cristalenap</a><p>We asked him to read "Baby Shark" and he has never heard of it. We were laughing so hard üòÇ <a title=babyshark href=#>#babyshark</a> <a title=babysharkdoodoo href=#>#babysharkdoodoo</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Cristalena ü§ç" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Cristalena ü§ç</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @cristalenap</span></figure><p>He then turns to Cristalena, who is recording the video, and quips, "People make this up and they buy it," before returning to the book and continuing reading: "Grandma shark, do-do-do-do-do, awee Grammy's wearing glasses too," the man says before singing more "do's" to the child before the video ultimately cuts out.</p><p>The TikToker writes in a caption for the video and provides an explanation for why Grandpa wasn't baby-sharking it appropriately: "We asked him to read 'Baby Shark' and he has never heard of it. We were laughing so hard"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cristalenap</span></figure><p>One commenter who saw the video joked that Cristalena's grandfather needed to hear the song so he, too, can be subjected to the incessant droning of "do-do-do-do's" leaving the song embedded in his mind for eternity.</p><p>"Now you have to play him the song because he too needs it stuck in his head forever," they joked.</p><p>Someone else vilified TikTok for re-introducing them to the Baby Shark tune because they were so close to finally forgetting it: "I almost forgotten the tune of BABY SHARK," they wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cristalenap</span></figure><p>For another person, however, they stated that hearing Grandpa's rendition of Baby Shark helped them to finally rid their minds of the scourge that was the viral track: "I never thought anything would wipe my memory clean of Baby Shark but now I can't remember the tune. He is doing the Lord‚Äôs work"</p><p>And then there were those who just loved grandpa's way of singing the track: "the way he say 'dodododo' is like he submerge an object in the water and then the bubbles comes up"</p><p>The 2015 viral song, which was produced by global entertainment children's brand <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinkfong and uploaded to YouTube on November 23rd, 2015</a>, was a massive success for the company.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cristalenap</span></figure><p>Believe it or not, however, there was a legal battle over ownership of the track, which was covered in-depth by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBC</a>. The song was also uploaded by Johnny Only to YouTube in 2011, and he noticed that whenever he sang the song to campers while he was working as a counselor and how hyped everyone would get when he would belt it out, he made his own version.</p><p>When Pinkfong's track became a massive hit, Johnny thought that the one published by the Korean company sounded a lot like the one he put online around 4 years prior: "Their version does seem strikingly similar to mine. Same key, same tempo change, same melody and rhythm," he wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cristalenap</span></figure><p>The same article went on to state that Only is currently wrapped up in a legal battle over copyright infringement when it comes to song rights usage, which he was initially confused about because, in his mind, since it was an oral tradition song passed along, that it fell under the public domain.</p><p>Which is why, when he was contacted by a South Korean political party in 2018 over the rights to use his song as part of their campaign, Only granted it to them as he thought it wasn't protected under copyright.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cristalenap</span></figure><p>However, upon discovering that Pinkfong had appended a copyright to their own version, and because he thought their track sounded so similarly to his, Only ended up taking his case to the Korean court system in the hopes of getting to the bottom of who the song belongs to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2BiusOpmGacn5rAr8CMpKWor12XrqPFjKyfmqqbYsCwusY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nvidia-geforce-gtx-980-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Maxwell 2 Architecture: Introducing GM204</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./buckwheat-boyz-every-interesting-fact-you-didnt-know-about-them.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Buckwheat Boyz- Every Interesting Fact You Didnt Know About Them</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
