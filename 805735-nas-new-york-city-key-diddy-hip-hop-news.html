The rap mogul has faced months of lawsuits leveling pretty serious accusations of bad behavior across decades. Just this week yet another lawsuit was filed against him. The newest includes claims that he drugged and sexually assaulted a model. Over the weekend, hotel security footage was leaked by CNN that shows Diddy allegedly assaulting <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cassie</a>. The video backed up claims made by Cassie in a lawsuit filed late last year.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now that the controversy has built up, fans online are calling for various boycotts of Diddy. Recently, exercise equipment company Peloton announced they would be removing his music from all future classes they put out. There's also been plenty of pressure applied by both fans and even members of government themselves for the rap mogul's key to the city to be revoked. When TMZ spoke to come representatives about it, a different rap figure from the city's history emerged as a potential replacement, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nas</a>. Diddy first received the key to the city last year, just a few months before the lawsuit filed by Cassie dropped.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-nas-suggested-as-alternate-to-diddy-for-key-to-new-york-city>Nas Suggested As Alternate To Diddy For Key To New York City</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nas just wrapped up a prolific 4 years run of new albums produced by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Hit-Boy</a>. The pair released an impressive 6 albums together in that span across two different trilogies. Magic 2 and Magic 3 dropped last year concluding their work together. Nas has continued to share new music videos from the two albums into this year. He also recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">revealed a special orchestra show</a> to celebrate the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">30th anniversary of his debut album Illmatic.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Do you think that the city of New York should rescind Diddy's key following the leaked footage of him allegedly assaulting Cassie? Do you think Nas is the best replacement if the key is eventually rescinded?
