Although all parties have seemingly moved on from the incident, it remains a memorable staple in pop culture.</p><p>After all, Baywatch babe <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a> was on-again, off-again with ex-husband Tommy Lee at the time and Kid Rock was also her ex-husband. So, to the world, folks believe that the fight was simply due to a love triangle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now that years have passed, the shocking fight has made headlines yet again due to Pamela’s new memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love, Pamela</a>.</p><p>So, why did the rock stars decide to throw fists at the 2007 MTV VMAs? Here’s everything that we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tommy Lee and Kid Rock's fight left Pamela Anderson feeling "bamboozled," she revealed in her memoir.</h2><p>Baby … the boys were fighting!</p><p>Pamela is holding nothing back in her newly released memoir Love, Pamela.</p><p>In the book, Pamela is very open about her failed marriages with both Kid Rock and Tommy Lee. Interestingly, the Baywatch icon also sheds some light on the famous brawl at the 2007 MTV VMAs. And according to Pam, MTV possibly set the entire thing up.</p><p>Keep in mind, Pamela had a romantic history with Tommy, whom she married in 1995 and divorced in 1998. However, Pam and Tommy had a history of breaking up and making up.</p><p>Pamela also wrote that she hadn’t kept in contact with or seen Kid since their divorce in 2006. So, when everyone attended the VMAs, it was the first time the former pair saw one another.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As Pamela went to take her seat past Kid, "Tommy pulled me onto his lap" and Pamela joked to <a href=#>Criss Angel</a> that she’d like for him to “make Tommy disappear.”</p><p>Kid watched the whole exchange go down and wasn’t pleased.</p><p>"Bob saw the whole thing and was fuming from his seat across from us," Pamela wrote.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Shortly after, her exes “dove at each other” and the fight ensued.</p><p>"Fists were flying, and the whole thing ended up on live TV. I walked out," she added. "It was a setup. MTV must have been thrilled.

He punches me in the face, well if ya want to call it that… more like a b---h slap! … Wuss!!”</p><p>Tommy shared that he was almost able to get revenge but was removed by security before he could defend himself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Remember when Tommy Lee and Kid Rock had a fight at the MTV awards?

It kills me just to be associated with it, to have my name in a sentence with him, it honestly destroys me.”</p><p>Kid also said that his fight with Tommy had nothing to do with Pam, as many folks speculated. He went on to recount instances in which he felt disrespected by Tommy.</p><p>“Last contact I had with him was when me and Pam were going through our divorce,” Kid said. "He picked up her BlackBerry and started emailing me a lot of horrendous things. It was extremely disrespectful.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Kid went on to share that the incident was bound to happen.</p><p>“This was unavoidable. I had to do what I had to do because this was a long time coming. You know, I came back from the bathroom and he was sitting right there. It was even more disrespectful after everything he said, I was like that’s enough, that’s it.”</p><p>There’s no telling if the dust has finally settled between the rock stars, but their fight is surely one fans will never forget.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyuudhmo56dXaC2pXnRqJqkZZaetKnA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dell-announces-the-venue-10-7000-tablet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dell Announces the Venue 10 7000 Tablet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tereza-mihalikova.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tereza Mihalikova</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
