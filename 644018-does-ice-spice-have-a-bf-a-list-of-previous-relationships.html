Since then, the Bronx rapper has been creating chart-topping songs and seen in the public eye with a variety of different celebrities, such as <a href=# class=text-word rel>Doja Cat</a> and Pink Pantheress.</p><p>However, there’s one particular thing fans are curious about: Ice Spice’s relationship status. Does the rapper have a boyfriend? Throughout her short time in the limelight, the Bronx-based rapper has been rumored to be with different men in the industry. Here is a list of the most notable men she’s been rumored to be with.</p><span><h2><strong>Caleb McLaughlin</strong></h2></span><p>Relationship rumors sparked on September 18 between Ice Spice and the Stranger Things star, Caleb McLaughlin. The duo was spotted at <a href=# class=text-word rel>Cardi B</a> and her husband, Offset’s annual event “Fashion Night Out” in New York. Both stars were invited and turned heads when they arrived together. An insider confirmed the rumors to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Media Take Out</a> that the two have been seeing each other for a few weeks at the time. “Ice Spice and Caleb are dating and are really into each other,” the insider said.&nbsp;</p><span></span><p>The pair were first rumored to be dating in August 2022 when Canadian rapper, Drake, slid into her DMs. What was it about Ice Spice that intrigued Drake? Her viral song “Munch (Feelin’ it). The 36-year-old Degrassi alumni flew the 23-year-old to attend Ovo Fest, his yearly three-day festival, in Toronto located in Canada. During an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Spotify's RapCaviar</a>, she shared her thoughts about meeting Drake</p><p>“I had just landed in L.A. for my Genius Open Mic for ‘Munch,’ and he was actually like, ‘Yo, ‘Munch’ is hard and your On the Radar freestyle is hard.’ And I was like, ‘Damn, that’s crazy because I’m really in L.A. about to shoot the Open Mic.'</p><p>“Linking up with him was so cool. Like, he’s mad nice and respectful. We went to OVO Fest. It was exciting because it was like his first time performing in Toronto, I think in like a couple of years. So it was just a movie, everybody was excited.”</p><p>However, there was speculated beef between both artists, after Drake unfollowed Ice Spice on Instagram. From there, he allegedly dissed her in his newest song “Her Loss” with 21 Savage. The one lyric from the song that stood out and fired the speculation was, “She a 10 tryna rap, it’s good on mute.”&nbsp;Even Ice Spice herself assumed the song was about her, responding in a tweet, “at least ima 10.”</p><p>But during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with The New York Times, she cleared the air, claiming that there’s no tension between her and Drake.</p><p>“We’re cool,” she told the outlet. “We spoke after that a couple times and we’re good. There’s no beef.”</p><span><h2><strong>Pete Davidson&nbsp;</strong></h2></span><p>The internet was sent into a frenzy after gossip of the “Gangsta Boo” singer and the former Saturday Night Live star, Pete Davidson dating, especially after Davidson was revealed to be in a relationship with Bodies Bodies Bodies actress, Chase Sui Wonders. Although TMZ reported that this was a joke, the dating rumors quickly started trending among fans on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>This rumor came from an Instagram meme account called @itsfinisher where they posted a side-by-side photo of “The Suicide Squad” actor and the rapper side by side, with the caption, "Pete Davidson is now dating NYC rapper Ice Spice.” Fans missed a crucial piece of information from the caption, that the post was created “for entertainment purposes only."</p><p>These rumors were shot down and put to rest. Currently, Davidson is in a relationship with Wonders and was first spotted together in December 2022. The two confirmed the relationship the following month.</p><span></span><p>In February, Ice Spice and rapper<a href=# rel> Lil Tjay </a>rose eyebrows after Tjay gifted the New York native a $150K RM-05 Rose Gold, white band Richard Mille watch on Valentine’s Day. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram post</a>, a jewelry store called Benny the Jeweler unveiled the beautiful watch and captioned, "When You Say You The King Of The City You Gotta Step Different EVERYTIME New Richard Millie RM-05 Rose Gold Gifted To @icespice from my brotha @liltjay."</p><p>Instantly, fans jumped to the conclusion that they were in a romantic relationship. However, these rumors were denied by both artists. Instead, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a>, the watch was presented to Ice Spice, a celebration of their collaborated song “Gangsta Boo” which reached number 82 on Billboard’s Hot 100. During an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Complex</a>, she revealed her dating life at the time.</p><p>"So, how I’m going to find time for somebody else? Even for family and friends, and myself, I’m still like that little bit of time that I be having on the side is for them and me. N***as come last," she said.</p><p>Apparently, the rappers were originally set to film the music video for "Gangsta Boo" but didn't due to Lil Tjay's arrest and charge for gun possession in January.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYFxfZdmm6ido2K2pLGMrKeim5VitaLCxGaYZpqWYq5uuMisq2anlmK9s7HVoqauq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr20</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./downton-abbey-star-michelle-dockery-is-flawless-in-royally-approved-dress.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery is FLAWLESS in royally-approved dress</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adata-xpg-v2-review-2400-c11.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>CPU Real World - ADATA XPG V2 Review: 2x8 GB at DDR3-2400 C11-13-13 1.65 V</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
