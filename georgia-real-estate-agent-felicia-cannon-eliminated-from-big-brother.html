The CBS producers have highlighted some of her amusing quirks including dropping the “Big Brother” mic into the toilet more than once and keeping all sorts of food (chicken included) in the pockets of her robe for convenient snacking. There were also jokes made about her constant references to the mustard seed and faith from the Bible.</p><p class=story-text data-index=7>Although Felicia won Head of Household in week three, she has been otherwise considered a weak competition player and has won nothing else since. Stronger competition players have been targeted for elimination up to this point. But she has been unable to guide her own destiny, never winning a veto competition.</p><p class=story-text data-index=8>Felicia has occasionally been too loose-lipped for other players to fully trust her. She has also been unable to maintain a solid alliance with another player that would have strengthened her position.</p><p class=story-text data-index=10>But at the same time, over the span of the game, Felicia has been a popular pawn, placed on the block for possible elimination seven times without actually getting voted out, the most ever in the show’s history. But eight times was not the charm for her.</p><p class=story-text data-index=12>Matt and Jag decided early on to be each other’s ride-or-die. One month into the 100-day show, Jag was voted off the show but, thanks to the audience vote, Matt was able to bring his friend back into the competition.</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>Jag has been a more strategic player and has made some big moves. He’s also a competition beast, winning several key Head of Household and veto competitions later in the game. Unlike Felicia, Jag has been able to control the game for weeks on end.</p><p class=story-text data-index=14>Matt wins points for affability and building strong relationships in the house. If it comes down to Jag and Matt, Matt might have a slight edge in terms of keeping his hands relatively clean. But the jury might give the $750,000 to Jag for being such a great strategist.</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>There is a fourth player: the sweet Australian “Bowie Jane” Ball. Despite some key competition wins, her gameplay hasn’t been seen as particularly strong. Matt and Jag promised her a final three in part because they feel they could beat her in any jury vote if either makes the final two with her. Or they could easily get rid of her if they need to.</p><p class=story-text data-index=16>Cameron Hardin, an entertaining Georgia stay-at-home father, evicted on day 72, was shown Sunday in the “Jury House” saying he supports Jag to win. Cirie Fields, the “Survivor” alum who was cut on Thursday, said she favors her close friend Matt and will likely vote for him as a juror.</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>IF YOU WATCH</b></h2><p class=story-text data-index=20>‘Big Brother,” two-hour season finale is this Thursday, Nov. 9 at 8 p.m. on CBS and available later on Paramount+</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orbCZ5qopV%2BhtqexjquYnaGfqcO1rcukZJukn5x8qLHOq56imV2nsqK4jJ6qrZmkmnqis8Snq2aelaG2pLXAZpqapp6ku26xy6KkoqaRqbKlecWrpqZlkp60bq7RqKuhnaJkn4KYrYuDf4B3j5SMgaVshpJvfH2Qjpapf4xo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./january-27-famous-birthdays.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>January 27 Famous Birthdays - SunSigns.Org</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charlie-hunnam-height-how-the-actor-stands-out-in-hollywood.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charlie Hunnam Height: How the Actor Stands Out in Hollywood</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
