The two shared their respective stories on social media in the wake of Floyd George's death that has caused outrage in the United States.</p><p>Ganesh shared Mukund's revelations on his Twitter handle, which the latter had posted in 2017. Ganesh stated he himself was subject to such taunts during his playing days but he couldn't have cared less.</p><p>"This story of @mukundabhinav reminded me of the racial jibes I went through in my playing days. Only an Indian legend was witness to it. It only made me strong & didn't deter me from playing for Ind & ovr 100 mts for Karnataka," Ganesh Tweeted.</p><p>Abhinav Mukund's full statement from August 9, 2017, reads: "I have been travelling a lot within and outside our country since I was 15. Ever since I was young, people's obsession with my skin colour has always been a mystery to me. Anyone who follows cricket would understand the obvious. I have played and trained day in and day out in the sun and not once have I regretted the fact that I have tanned or lost a couple of shades. It is simply because I love what I do and I have been able to achieve certain things only because I have spent hours outdoor. I come from Chennai, probably one of the hottest places in our country and I have gladly spent most of my adult life in the cricket ground.</p><p>"I have laughed and shrugged it off because I had bigger goals! Affected young, I toughened up because this was never something that would pull me down. There were many times when I chose not to dignify these insults with responses. With the rise of social media, it has gone to a magnitude that I see people hurling abuses left, right and centre at something I have absolutely no control over. Fair isn't the only lovely or handsome guys. Stay true, stay focused, be comfortable in your own skin."</p><p>Floyd's death has caused a nationwide protest in the US. Floyd, aged 46, died last week shortly after Derek Chauvin, a police officer, held him down with a knee on his neck though he repeatedly pleaded, "I can't breathe," and "please, I can't breathe".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/sports/cricket/images/2020/6/3/mukund.jpg.transform/576x300/image.jpg><p>Sports superstars have shown support to the protests on social media with a 'blackout' -- uploading a black image alongside a message of support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e8KroJyjlal8c3yRaWZpbl9lgHCwzp2bmmWXlrumv8dmmJugmaOut3nMrqKuppRiv6KvyJqjZpmSqsCmecaepquflWKzrbvYnWWhrJ2h</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gigi-hadid-modeling-tiring-pregnant.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gigi Hadid Describes Pregnant Modeling as Much &amp;quot;More Tiring&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-moisturiser-for-dry-skin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 best moisturisers for dry skin: Hydrating moisturizers tried &amp;amp; tested</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
