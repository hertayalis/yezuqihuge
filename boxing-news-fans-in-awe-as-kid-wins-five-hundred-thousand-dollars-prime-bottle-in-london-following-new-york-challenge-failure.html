The brainchild of <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>KSI</strong></a> and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Logan Paul</strong></a> will celebrate its second birth anniversary in another two months. To celebrate the feat, the co-founders launched a special promotion. Paul and KSI asked the followers to help them crack a code to get access to a special case containing the prize: a <strong>Golden Prime</strong> bottle. However, for those who participated in the event, there was a time limit. They had only 48 hours to break the code to claim the golden prize, said to be worth $500,000. And as it happened, in the United Kingdom, two children were able to find solutions.</p><p>Thus, it became an easy job for KSI. Then what happened to the one in New York? Per the conditions of the challenge, out of the two golden bottles, one in New York and the other in London, the bottle at the location where the riddle gets cracked first shall survive. The remaining one is to be melted down. Thus, Logan Paul had to do the honors and down went $500,000 through the smelting fire. Prime Hydration, through their Instagram account, shared the clips of the happy kid in London who won the grand prize.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>London 1, New York 0: A kid in England celebrates a bumper fortune</strong></h2><p>The @drinkprime post read, “$500k won instantly, $500k lost instantly. Thanks to everyone who made this activation so special! Here’s to the next billion.” London: The clip starts with a countdown: “Three, two…” The excited face of the youngster appears. KSI shouts, “Oh&nbsp;my God!” It was heartwarming to see the prize winner, his mother, and his sibling whizzing around with sheer joy amidst the announcement, “We&nbsp;have the winner in London!”</p><p>But in New York, an excited Logan Paul asks, “They got it? No, it means ours is getting burned!” Probably it will take many back to the ending scenes of Terminator II, where <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a></strong>‘s character T-800 lowers himself into molten steel. The New York Golden Prime bottle gradually heads down for melting. Watching it live, KSI shouts, “Oh, it’s melting; the gold in New York is melting.” Back in the United States, Logan Paul rues the loss: “That hurts; that’s $250,000 gone, just like that…”</p><p>During his appearance on <strong>Fox Business Live</strong>, Logan Paul said that Prime Hydration had a business worth $1.2 billion in 2023.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Fortunes in Boxing and Business</strong></h2><p>Logan Paul and KSI started off fighting each other in the ring. While their first bout, an amateur one, ended in a draw, the second one, which took place over a year later, ended in a loss for the American YouTuber. But the duo was able to cast aside their rivalry and forge a business partnership. Prime Hydration was launched in January 2022. The energy drink’s popularity has skyrocketed ever since. Reportedly, its sales have followed suit, increasing by leaps and bounds.</p><p>As far as boxing is concerned, Paul emerged a winner as he returned to boxing after a gap of four years. He defeated <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Dillon Danis</strong></a> on October 14 at the <strong>MF & DAZN—The Prime Card</strong>. On the other hand, for KSI, the results in the rings haven’t been so encouraging. He won the year’s first bout against <strong>FaZe Temperrr</strong>. However, during the next two, he hasn’t been so lucky. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>The fight against Joe Fournier ended in a no-contest</a>. Whereas he suffered his first loss to rival <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Tommy Fury</strong></a> on The Prime Card.</p><p>With his recent win over Dillon Danis, do you believe that Logan Paul should look out for more fights in the ring?
