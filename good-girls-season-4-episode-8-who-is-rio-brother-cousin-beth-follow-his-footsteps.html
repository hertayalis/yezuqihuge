But while Grandma may be the boss, it’s Rio’s brother/cousin Mick (Carlos Aviles) -- we’re still not sure which -- who seems to be the brains behind this family’s smooth criminals.</p><p>We get to see in a flashback how Rio and Mick, as young adults work in a posh country club. One day Mick spots Rio stealing from a locker and then turns him into the authorities. But while it seems at first, it’s Mick's high moral standards that led to this decision, there is in fact a larger reason at play.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Good Girls' Season 4 Episode 7: What happens after Rio discovers Beth's wire? Here's why a new mom meets him</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Good Girls' Season 4 Episode 6: Did Beth use sex to distract Rio from finding out about her FBI connection?</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/79dae28e-ca47-4373-8edb-c6ffb823cead.JPG><p>We later realize that Mick turned in Rio, only to be seen as truthful and honest, so that when he actually does commit crimes with Rio no one will believe that he could be behind them. This is why when Beth turns in Rio to the police and informs them when she will be handing over laundered money to him, Rio and Mick decide to not get rid of Beth.</p><p>Mick uses his considerable clout as a councilman to get Rio out of jail. Beth thinks Rio has been safely put away, but little does she know her nightmare continues. When Rio then goes to Beth’s house, she begs him not to hurt her children, he says he’s not going to hurt anyone. She can’t understand why. Rio then tells her that like he discovered with his brother/cousin, who turned him in to get the confidence of the powers that be, the FBI and police will now believe anything she says and she and Rio can do whatever they want. What exactly do Rio and Mick have planned for Beth? Will Beth find herself falling for Mick against her better judgement? To find out you can catch the latest episodes of 'Good Girls' On Sundays at 10/9c on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRon5%2BksW6zyKujrGWjmq60u81ma2adoJ7AsLDEZm9mr5ikeqq%2FjKugqGWSp7y1tMSrZJynpai2r3nBnquhZZakua271mafoqtdm7ywwNKtnKmr</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./modern-family-star-nolan-gould-grew-up-before-americas-eyes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Modern Family' star Nolan Gould grew up before America's eyes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jid-smino-announce-co-headlining-luv-is-4ever-tour-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JID &amp;amp; SMINO Announce Co-Headlining Luv Is 4ever Tour 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
