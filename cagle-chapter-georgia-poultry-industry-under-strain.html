Production prices have increased as prices for chicken have dropped. As Georgia producers lower their output to get in balance with demand, employment in processing plants has dropped.</p><p class=story-text data-index=5>Cagle's, which began 60 years ago as a chicken shop in downtown Atlanta, listed $92 million in assets and $62.9 million in debts in papers filed Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Georgia. Chapter 11 bankruptcy protects a company's assets while a business continues to operate and work out payments with creditors.</p><p class=story-text data-index=6>It is the 21st largest producer in the U.S., according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association.</p><p class=story-text data-index=7>Calls to Cagle's and the company's attorney were not returned.</p><p class=story-text data-index=8>The industry has been under heavy economic pressure in the past year, said John McKissick, an agricultural economist at the University of Georgia. Feed prices, which represent half or more of the price of chicken on market shelves, doubled and fuel prices rose as prices for chicken fell and consumption dropped slightly. Improvement will take time, he said.</p><p class=story-text data-index=10>"They are going to be under tremendous strain for next year," McKissick said of the industry.</p><p class=story-text data-index=12>Poultry is the state's leading agricultural output, says the state Department of Agriculture. Georgia ships chicken across the U.S. and the world.</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>The industry, including companies that sell to or service chicken producers, employs about 100,000 workers in Georgia, said Michael Lacy, the head of the University of Georgia's poultry science department.</p><p class=story-text data-index=14>The state Department of Labor says the number of workers in processing plants peaked in 2007 at more than 33,000. As of last March, that was down about 10 percent to 29,887.</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>Cagle's laid off about 300 people at its plant in Pine Mountain last June to cut costs and production, a company financial report said.</p><p class=story-text data-index=16>The report said feed prices had increased 68 percent compared with the same time period in 2010. The publicly traded but still largely family-owned and -operated company had cut administrative expenses and reduced executive compensation and insurance costs. It lost $5.7 million for the quarter even with a 4 percent increase in sales.</p><p class=story-text data-index=19>Cagle's employed 1,900, according to Hoovers, a firm that tracks companies. That figure is from March 2011, before the layoffs.</p><p class=story-text data-index=20>Lacy said, "I'm sure there have been some cutbacks, but Cagle's is still going to be processing chicken. They still need people to grow and serve and sell those birds. I don't think there will be significant cutbacks in employees, but there will be some."</p><p class=story-text data-index=21>Bankruptcy documents say Cagle's owes more than 1,000 creditors, including a string of feed companies, transportation companies, utilities and American Express.</p><p class=story-text data-index=22>Two other producers -- Townsends and Allen Family Foods, both of Delaware -- also filed Chapter 11 since last December. Both are being purchased by other companies.</p><p class=story-text data-index=23>The industry is cyclical, Lacy said.</p><p class=story-text data-index=25>"But this downturn has been a little deeper and longer than we are used to. But I would think we have to be close to the bottom of the downturn."</p><p class=story-text data-index=26>Mike Giles, president of the Georgia Poultry Federation, said, "There have been down cycles in the past and there will be more in the future, but the overall situation occurring now is one of the most challenging that our industry has ever faced."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orbCZ5qopV%2BXwrS1zZ6qrGeTlrStsYycn5qopJq%2FbrPEqKmgoZFivbDBy62psmWZo7G2v9OrsGatnpmys3nSramaoZ5km3WPy3ugmp50gryOfsGsq4SthWqAins%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fantasy-busts-2022-a-list-of-the-most-overrated-players-in-order-of-do-not-draft.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fantasy Busts 2022: a list of the most overrated players in order of Do Not Draft.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amy-robach-divorce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amy Robach Divorce: Is the News of her Divorce True?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
