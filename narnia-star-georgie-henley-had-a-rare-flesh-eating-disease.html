They are a map of the pain my body has endured, and most importantly a reminder of my survival,” she said. “They do not affect my capacity as an actor, and I’m proud to be a person who has visible scars in this industry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlma25fo66zusiaZKyskad6qLHOq56inV2dsq%2B4xLJkoZmUYq5uvsCrnGaenJrAqXnEmquippdisaq%2FxJqqnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./abigail-duhon-net-worth-280430.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Abigail Duhon Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zion-williamson-bio-age-siblings-height-girlfriend-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zion Williamson Bio, Age, Siblings, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
