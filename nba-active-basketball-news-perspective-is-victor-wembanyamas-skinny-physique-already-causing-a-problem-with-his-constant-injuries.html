The league attracts the very best players, with aspiring hoopers harboring dreams of playing for coveted NBA teams. However, only a lucky but talented few make the cut. In its 77 years of history, only 4,374 players have graced an NBA court. Among the select few who do have the privilege to play in the league, only a handful go on to achieve the revered status of an NBA icon.</p><p>Iconic NBA figures such as Jordan, Magic, and Julius Irving played pivotal roles in advancing the game and elevating the NBA’s popularity. Consequently, the emergence of transcendent talents becomes imperative to fill the void left by these iconic predecessors. Current players like Kevin Durant, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>LeBron James</a>, and Stephen Curry have captivated the global audience through their exceptional on-court performances. However, as they approach the twilight of their illustrious careers, the NBA requires emerging superstars to usher the league into its next era. Few names sound as intriguing as rookie Victor Wembanyama. The NBA has never seen a player of his size and skills. However, a question arises: could his “skinny” frame hamper what could potentially be a generational NBA career?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Will injuries take a toll on Wembanyama’s body?</h2><p>Victor Wembanyama came into the NBA with much fanfare, and rightfully so, because players like him are generational talents. The San Antonio Spurs drafted him with the 1st pick in the 2023 NBA draft. He is the player whom many Spurs fans have pinned their hopes on to take their beloved team back to the very top of the NBA. However, despite his undeniable generational talents, there have been some injury concerns related to his “skinny” frame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-11-15T015514Z_1873770763_MT1USATODAY21897661_RTRMADP_3_NBA-SAN-ANTONIO-SPURS-AT-OKLAHOMA-CITY-THUNDER.jpg><p>Traditionally, players over the height of 7 feet have suffered from chronic and debilitating foot injuries. NBA legends like Bill Walton, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Joel Embiid</a>, and Yao Ming have all dealt with recurring injuries. Chet Holmgren, a fellow rookie, sat out his entire first season after sustaining a lis franc injury in a preseason Pro-Am game.</p><p>In his young NBA career, Wembanyama has missed three games due to an ankle injury. Recently, he missed a game against the Dallas Mavericks after he twisted his ankle while warming up. This has sparked worries about his susceptibility to injuries. While it’s concerning to see Wembanyama get injured, up until now, he has shown that he can deal with the physical nature of the NBA. Injuries are part and parcel of basketball, however, Wembanyama came into the league much better prepared than a lot of rookies.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Wembanyama is ahead of the curve</h2><p>The Spurs are quite aware of the injury concerns that come with being over 7 feet tall. To enhance Wembanyama’s conditioning, the Spurs have brought on board his personal strength and conditioning coach, Guillaume Alquier. Alquier has been working with Victor since his days with the Mets 92.</p><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>In an interview with ESPN</a>, Alquier explained Wemby’s workout regimen. He said, “The most important thing is to have strength in the legs, to produce force to play basketball: To play inside, to play D, post up, everything. After that, you have core activation, and the last thing is the prevention stuff—trying to do the best thing to be healthy all the time during the season.”</p><p>Wembanyama’s concentrated efforts to prevent injuries have yielded positive results, as Victor lacks an extensive injury history, a common concern among many fellow 7-footers. The last major injury Wembanyama suffered was in June 2022. He suffered a PSOAS injury, which ruled him out from Villeurbanne’s postseason run. He played the entirety of the next season for the Metropolitans 92.</p><p>Wembanyama has a strong support team that constantly monitors his food intake and sleeping habits. Furthermore, they have provided him with a comprehensive workout regimen focused on stretching and exercises designed to strengthen his feet and align his core to prevent injuries. In an <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>article for ESPN</a>, Brian Windhorst provided some insights into Victor’s meticulous pre-game routine. He wrote, “With shoes and socks off sitting on the floor, Alquier has him crawl on his fingertips and toes in an effort to strengthen his core … Since he was 15, Wembanyama has been working to align his knees and learn how to land to soften the load.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Can Wembanyama lead the Spurs into a new era of dominance?</h2><p>For the better part of the 21st century, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>San Antonio Spurs</a> were synonymous with winning and success. Players like Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, and Kawhi Leonard established the Spurs as a dominant force in the modern NBA. However, the last few years haven’t been kind to the Spurs fans. They constantly find themselves rooted to the bottom of the standings in recent seasons.</p><p>However, Wembanyama’s arrival has given the Spurs fanbase renewed hope and optimism for the future. Apart from Victor, the Spurs possess a bevy of talented young players like Jeremy Sochan, Devin Vassell, and Keldon Johnson. If the Spurs hierarchy plays their cards correctly, then the Spurs could become a future dynasty. However, the prospect of their future success unquestionably relies on the continual development of Victor Wembanyama.</p><p><strong>Watch this Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Chris Paul annihilates Scott Foster after the controversial call, ‘Don’t use a tech to get your point across’</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Kaq56fn6fGcLrBmmanmpFirqTAyK%2BcZpqRqLimwMGao6VlnprEtHnPnqmsqJWYwarCxGagrGWmnrC1u9Fmrp6lkpa7uq3Mmqpmq5ueu6%2FFjKmfsquZpsKmecClqZ6ZlK56pK3UrKCnn12WerG%2BzpujnqVdrLa1tIyhoKxlk6S7tMDAp6tmoZ6fwrO1xKxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-ngo-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Ngo - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bill-meehan-obituary-a-beloved-father-grandfather-and-friend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bill Meehan Obituary, A Beloved Father, Grandfather, And Friend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
