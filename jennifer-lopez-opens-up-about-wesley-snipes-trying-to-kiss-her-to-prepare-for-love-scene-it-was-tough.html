The romantic scene was with Wesley Snipes. J-Lo admits since she was new to the movie industry, she didn't want to be "difficult" to work with, so she didn't voice her concerns. She said, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"When you first start working <a href=#>professionally</a>, you push the boundaries of what you should and shouldn't do, and I didn't think I had the right to say no, like, 'No, I'm not doing this, and that's it...' So we did it, and it was tough," she continued,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Wesley was wonderful about it in the sense that he was like, 'What's gonna make you more comfortable?' and I was like, 'Bring music, play it loud.'"</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The publication also reports J-Lo said Wesley tried to kiss her outside of filming. She said, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Wesley–even though I had a boyfriend at the time–went full court press. He was flirting with me–you always flirt with your costars, it's harmless–then he just started getting a little more serious." She continued,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"He would invite us all out together and then at the end of the night, he'd drop me off last and try to kiss me. I'd be like, 'Wesley, please, I'm not interested in you like that.' He got really upset about it."</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wesley responded and said, "What happened was, she had never done a love scene before. She was absolutely terrified. I was given instructions from the director to make her feel good. That was my job." He continued, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"I knew people would look at the screen and say either, "They have chemistry," or, "They don't." I told her, if she took my <a href=#>advice</a> we'd do a wonderful, erotic scene. And if it wasn't a good love scene, they'd edit around her and throw it on the floor."</span>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVJYbMRp6sR/?utm_medium=copy_link<a href=#><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Via</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTcm5nm5%2BifKm702alnq%2BjZLemus2inZ6qXaG8sbHZZqapnZ6oera8jJqZqK2kYsSmv8uesGarnp69pr%2BMramyoZ6cerW7jKSgrKtdnbKzedOoZKmqlaWus7GMn6arZZykw6Z50pycp51dnsFuw8CsZK2npZy1</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lg-optimus-4x-hd-international-quadcore-love.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LG Optimus 4X HD: Tegra 3 Handsets Stay Global</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-gary-rossington-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gary Rossington? | Wiki, Age, Bio, Net Worth, Career, Relationship,Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-the-wife-of-joe-montana.html>All About The Wife Of Joe Montana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-servants-in-fate-grand-order.html>Best Servants in Fate Grand Order</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-split-everything-we-know-past-temporary-breakup.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas once temporarily split - everything we know about their pas</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html>English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
