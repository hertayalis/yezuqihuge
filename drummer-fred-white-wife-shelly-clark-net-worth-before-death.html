Stay with us until the conclusion to learn more about Fred White’s wife and other personal information.</strong></p><p>Fred E. White is an American singer-songwriter and musician. He was one of the original members of Earth, Wind, and Fire.</p><p>He has previously played drums on Donny Hathaway’s Live CD.</p><p>Earth, Wind & Fire, which included Fred White’s brother Verdine White, half-brother Maurice White, and other musicians, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Fred_White8217s_Wife_Shelly_Clark_His_Family_Information>Who Is Fred White’s Wife Shelly Clark? His Family Information</span></h2><p>Shelly Clark is Fred White’s wife. We looked on the internet but found nothing on the drummer’s wife and children.</p><p>Because of his private life, no information about them is made public. It’s even unclear why the drummer got married in the first place.</p><p>Fred White grew raised with two other siblings. They are Verdine White and Maurice White. Verdine White is a well-known American musician who was a part of the Earth, Wine, and Fire band.</p><p>He is a bassist. Verdine was born on July 25, 1951. Maurice is an important member of the Earth, Wine, and Fire bank.</p><p>He is well recognized as the band’s producer and lyricist. Maurice died on February 4, 2016, after being born on December 19, 1941.</p><h2><span id=Prodigious_Drummer_Fred_White_died_at_the_age_of_67>Prodigious Drummer Fred White died at the age of 67.</span></h2><p>Thanks to the drumming of Earth, Wind & Fire’s Fred White, who died on Sunday, the nation’s weddings, bar mitzvahs, high school reunions, and any other event where people of all ages danced were soundtracked by some of the funkiest melodies in pop history.</p><p>Verdine White, the band’s bassist, shared a note on Instagram regarding his brother’s death.</p><p>The notification provided no location or explanation for his demise.</p><p>Frederick Eugene Adams was born in Chicago on January 13, 1955. He and Maurice shared a mother, Edna White, a housewife. His father, Verdine Sr., was a podiatrist.</p><p>Fred began playing the drums at the age of nine. Maurice coined the term “child prodigy” for him. Fred, like Verdine Jr., changed his last name to White to make it more evident that he was connected to Maurice.</p><p>According to Fred, who told Modern Drummer magazine in 1982 that he grew up “in the ghetto of Chicago,” drums provided him with a sense of purpose.</p><p>He began doing shows when he was just 13 years old. At the age of 14, he joined a band that performed in bars.</p><p>He began performing with soul musician Donny Hathaway at the age of 15 and making up excuses for missing sessions due to school.</p><h2><span id=Fred_White8217s_Pre-Death_Net_Worth>Fred White’s Pre-Death Net Worth</span></h2><p>Fred had a net worth of around $2 million at the time of his death, according to opoyi.com. He made a lot of money as a musician for many years.</p><p>In addition, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.</p><p>After completing a tour with the rock group Little Feat, Maurice and Verdine determined that Fred had the ability to perform with Earth, Wind & Fire. Fred, you’re still a teen.</p><p>Mr. White also has a sister named Geri, in addition to Verdine. Maurice White, 74, died in 2016. The total number of survivors was not immediately known.</p><p>Maurice described Fred as a “daredevil spirit” who was “cocky, young, and a little bit arrogant” and generated problems with his bandmates, notably owing to the unusual circumstance of having two drummers perform onstage at the same time in his memoirs.</p><p>Because he was “used to being the only drummer and carrying the band,” Fred White revealed to Modern Drummer that his early years of sharing drumming duties with Mr. Johnson were a “struggle.”</p><h3><span id=Also_Read_Wife_Girlfriend_And_Family_Of_Adam_G_Sevani><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
