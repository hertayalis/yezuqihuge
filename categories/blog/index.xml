今でも個性派として、音楽だけでなく人間味でも関心を引く魅力的な方です。
５０歳を超えた現在も、高身長で細身のスタイルを保ち、
ボーカルの櫻井さんとともにBUCK-TICKのライブの中心にいます。
そんな今井さんは、櫻井さんと同じく、
長く独身貴族を貫いていました。
結婚は櫻井さんよりも早い、
２００８年という時期・・・。
当時は先を越された感がありましたが、
今では互いに嫁持ちということで、
メイン２人の私生活の変化に時代を感じます。
今井寿(BUCK-TICK)に嫁と子供はいる？ ２００８年の５月にファンに結婚を発表した今井寿さん。
当時は、ファンも祝福モードで、櫻井さんの時ほどの意外性はありませんでした。
そして、結婚した嫁さんとの間には、
すでに子供も誕生しているようです！
今井は「8月某日 家族が増えました。第一子誕生ってヤツです」と短く明かすと、「もっと、何かいろいろとブログで書くんだろうな・・ と、自分で思ってたけど、何も出てこないです。何も（笑）」とユーモアを交えて報告。引用元：http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2028016/full/
自身のブログの中での報告ということで、
週刊誌よりも先にファンに伝わるという最高の形でした。
自分の心境を素直に書くブログは好評で、
子供の誕生の際にも、本当はもっと色々書きたかった様子。
しかし、この子供に関しては、
性別や名前などは一切明らかになっていません。
もしかしたら、今井さんのブログを辿れば、
どこかに書いてるかも？とは思いますが・・・。
嫁さんとその姉貴さんは、
震災の際に、善意ある行動をされて話題となりました。
その嫁さんの姉さんは恵比寿のバーにいる方らしく、
過去には今井さんがブログで紹介されていました。
また、姉さんはブログもやっており、
そのブログも紹介されています。
ブログを見てる限り、かなり綺麗な方・・、
そして今井さんの嫁さんも絶対に美人でしょうね・・・。
仲の良い美人姉妹って、なんか羨ましいですよね。
って、女性ファンからの嫉妬を煽らないか心配になります！笑
今井寿(BUCK-TICK)に逮捕された過去 意外と知られてないですが、
今井さんには、逮捕された過去があります。
１９８９年４月当時、
バクチクも全盛期で、
かなり大きく報道されました。
ただ、容疑の内容は、
アスカさんほど酷い内容ではなく、
当時のバンドマンの常識の範囲では、
「ちょっと悪い」ぐらいの内容だったと思います。
裁判の際には、
今井さん見たさに、
多くのファンが駆けつけ、
まるでライブ会場の前のような、
異様な雰囲気になっていたそうです。
それでもバクチクメンバーは、
神妙な会見を開き、自分のことのように謝罪。
このバンドメンバーの団結力というか、
連帯責任が強いバンドあることが、また素敵に思えました。
もちろん、今井さんも深く反省し、
その後のライブでも今まで以上に熱心なパフォーマンスを披露してました。
過去には雑誌で、独房について語ることもあり、
当時のことを隠そうとも思ってないようです。
素直で気持ちの良い性格が、
この逮捕の後の発言でわかります。
独特な音楽性に加えて、
個性的な性格、生活感が、
今井寿さんのカリスマ性に繋がっているのでしょう！

It’s to be noted that this is the typical capacity of the battery while the rated capacity is 3880mAh / 14.93Wh.
We’ve seen from competing smartphones that what’s almost always more important than the actual battery capacity is the power efficiency of the components. We do expect the OP7Pro to have a higher power drain than competing smartphones due to the 90Hz screen, but the question is as to exactly how much more drain we’ll be seeing.</description></item><item><title>blisstree</title><link>/blisstree.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blisstree.html</guid><description>NavigationSocial

My head is in the clouds right now
Just pray I come around, around
